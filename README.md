# License
Released under the MIT LICENSE - check the LICENSE file

# How to:
- Download obs-ws.py and run.sh
- Change the variables in obs-ws.py to your setup
* Filepath has to be with / and not \, can be done in python but this is just a dirty script to get going.
* The timestamp is the Danish Timestamp format, can be changed to your liking. Look into datetime documentation.
* OBSIP, OBSPORT, OBSPASSWORD and OBSScene (OBSScene is the scene in your OBS you would like to take a picture of.
- Make +x on run.sh (due to Octolapse not being able to execute Python directly (i couldnt get it working atleast).
- Test it locally before putting Octolapse into the mix (./run.sh)
- Make Octolapse run run.sh (for example /home/pi/run.sh) in "External Camera Setup - Script" under the default camera.
